# Student Management System ( TASK 5 )

## Description:
The Student Management System project, developed during my internship at Codsoft, facilitates the management of student records. It includes a Student class to represent individual students, a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students, and functionalities to interact with the system via a user interface.

## Features:
- **Student Class:** Represents individual students with attributes like name, roll number, grade, etc.
- **Management System Class:** Manages student collection with methods for adding, removing, searching, and displaying students.
- **User Interface:** Design allows user interaction through a console-based or graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing, JavaFX, etc.
- **Data Storage:** Implements methods to read and write student data to a storage medium like a file or a database.
- **User Interaction:** Offers options for adding a new student, editing student information, searching, displaying all students, and exiting the application.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures required fields are filled and student data is in the correct format.
